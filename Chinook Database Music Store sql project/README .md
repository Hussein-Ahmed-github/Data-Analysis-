## Introduction

In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
## Installation

All you'll need to do here is...

    Download your new database
    Download DB Browser for SQLite

As soon as you have DB Browser for SQLite connected to your new database, you're ready for the next page!
Download DB Browser for SQLite

Many different database browsers work with different types of databases. For this project, we'll be using the DB Browser for SQLite. The other browsers you may use will likely be very similar.

DB Browser for SQLite can be downloaded from their website in the downloads sections. Choose the right version (Windows/Mac) for your computer setup.
